# py3-canvaslms-api
Python 3 API wrapper for Instructure's Canvas LMS with real-world examples of use.

Simplifies tasks and reporting involving assignments, courses, enrollments, outcomes, roles, subaccounts, and users.

Also includes functions that simplify performing SIS imports and exports, querying databases, and working with CSV and XSLX files.

The "core" directory contains the scripts that the API wrapper functions are in, as well as config.json, which you'll need to edit to match your environment. (You might also need to edit config.py). 

All other directories contain scripts using the core functions to accomplish tasks.
